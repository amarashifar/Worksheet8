      2 If Fernicola had stuck to the facts, his book would be worth a higher rating than a two. I think that his attempt to intermingle social history with the shark incidents is interesting. Unfortunately, his investigation of the 1916 New Jersey shark attacks is a mishmash of facts, errors, and fanciful views. One imaginative section deals with a supposed linkage between German espionage in America, U-boats along the East Coast, and the shark attacks. I will deal with this later. Then there are glaring errors in at least one section. <br />First of all, during the summer of 1916, only one German merchant submarine appeared on the East Coast, not &quot;U-boats in multiple U.S. ports.&quot; Fernicola may be confusing the friendly visit made to a New England port several months later by U-53. Fernicola refers again to visits on the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England coasts during this time by two German U-boats, the &quot;Deutschland&quot; and the &quot;Bremen.&quot; The &quot;Deutschland,&quot; an undersea unarmed freighter arrived in Baltimore on July 10, 1916 and returned to the States on November 1. Actually, the &quot;Bremen,&quot; the other merchant sub mentioned by Fernicola, never reached the American seaboard, as it was lost at sea soon after departing Germany.<br />The author would have you believe that the submarines were to carry condensed milk and foodstuffs back to Germany. This was only one of many rumors as to the submersibles' intended cargo. The fact is, it became well-known before her departure from Baltimore in August that the &quot;Deutschland&quot; would carry much-  needed metals and crude rubber as a valuable military cargo.<br />Let me mention a few more inaccuracies. Contrary to Fernicola's thinking, the captain of the &quot;Deutschland&quot; never refused an inspection by U.S. officials. If this had happened, the sub would have been promptly interned. American officials made a thorough investigation of the vessel in port to determine whether itcarried torpedoes, torpedo tubes, or deck guns. Within two days, it was announced that the submarine was truly a civilian cargo-bearing vessel, lacking armament, and would be treated like any surface merchant ship of a belligerent nation that entered an American harbor. This is contrary to the impression left by Fernicola that the government seriously considered detaining the boat permanently because it might be a warship. The author emphasizes the fact that she &quot;carried two small-caliber guns.&quot; not realizing that the Captain and officers of most merchant ships routinely carry on board small arms, especially during wartime. Also, the author states that the sub moved north and stopped in Bridgeport, Connecticut on its way back to Germany. This is another piece of fiction. <br />These and other errors may derive from an effort to put out the book in a hurry to a country where shark attacks were big news in 2001. There were many rumors, mixed with facts, published in 1916 newspapers about the shark attacks, German espionage, and sightings of U-boats off the Atlantic coast. But the unverified snippets selectively-chosen are fuel for gossip, and should not underlie a serious book of non-fiction. Even the major newspapers, which Fernicola said he examined, carried well-written, factually-based articles. It's a pity that Fernicola never consulted the authoritative book by Dwight Messimer, &quot;The Merchant U-Boat: Adventures of the Deutschland, 1916-1918.&quot;<br />The large number of errors detected in this section of the book makes me wonder how careful the author was about the rest of the volume. The other major problem I have with this work concerns the attempt to invoke conspiracy in the summer shark attacks. The author tries unsuccessfully to associate the shark attacks with German espionage and marauding U-boats on the East Coast. Furthermore, Fernicola spins out a web of fantasy trying to convince readers that the enterprising Germans used &quot;a diabolical new device to cause innocent swimmers to become lunch for marauding sharks.&quot; There is not a shred of evidence presented for such fiction. Such writing may help to sell books but it detracts from good expository writing and scholarship. I cannot recommend this book to serious readers.
      1 With over 1200 reviews written about this book, it is obviously a hot button item, but in looking at a sampling of the reviews, the only ones that really count would seem to be people who have actually read it, which few if any, of the \\"one star\\" reviewers have actually done. Few of these people show any record of previous reviews, or the ones they have submitted are mostly with a far left wing point of view.<br /><br />One might debate whether Kerry was a \\"hero\\" for one of his awards, (and it could be only one of them at the most) but no one can debate that Kerry is a self-admitted war criminal. It is obvious that Kerry was someone who knew the \\"three purples\\" and you are out policy and it pretty obvious from eye witness accounts that he did not deserve at least two of them since they were self-inflicted and did not occur under enemy fire. But to me the most important parts of the book are not the specifics of who shot (or didn't shoot) John. Most telling are the Senator's own words which have changed so many times over the years as to make him someone who could never be believed. His testimony in front of the Senate in 1971 is based upon unverified and undocumented accounts of so-called veterans, most of whom never wore a uniform. He denied still being a member of the VVAW when that group was advocating the assassination of Congressmen, and only changed his story when the FBI released their records this year. When he was given his draft notice, he asked for a deferment to be able to study French for a year, but was turned down. Rather than be drafted, he joined the US Navy Reserves, not the US Navy and was unlucky enough to be activated. (The navy reserves were the Navy equivalent of the Air National Guard that Bush is so derided for joining.) Instead of having two tours of Vietnam as he claimed, his first \\"tour\\" included 5 weeks in the Tonkin gulf, not even within sight of Vietnam on a large ship that spent most of his one year tour off the coasts of California and Australia. When Kerry volunteered for Swift Boat duty, it was the safest tour in the Navy since it was really a taxi from big ships to safe harbors. He vehemently objected to reporting for duty when the mission changed. His first purple heart was awarded mysteriously after the attending physician said he had seen worse scrapes from a rose bush and refused to recommend him for one. It is no wonder that Kerry has refused to release all of his records. Especially since Kerry was the one who fired his weapon too close to shore and his \\"wound\\" came from a tiny piece of shrapnel from his own weapon, and there was no hostile fire that night anywhere near his boat.<br /><br />But the book is not just about \\"he said, he said\\" versus his fellow vets. It is a story of someone who took his own movie camera and \\"reenacted\\" fights which never occurred so that he could be, as he said himself, the \\"Next JFK\\".<br /><br />It is the story of a very flawed man whose record in the Senate could be predicted by his actions in Vietnam. If you really want to put someone in office who has no moral compass, than you couldn't find anyone better than Kerry, with the possible exception of the draft dodger the Democrats nominated when Kerry said Vietnam service shouldn't be a consideration for electing someone as President. But of course the imperious senator would brook no dissent from those opposed to him, as we see in his attack on the first amendment rights of his fellow Vietnam vets who happen to disagree with him about his qualifications for service as president. As Senator Edwards requested, the American people are spending \\"three minutes\\" with Kerry's fellow vets to find out what kind of man he is. Kerry's problem is that the \\"conversation\\" isn't limited to just the five he wanted us to hear from, we are hearing it from the hundreds who served on his boat, or within 50 feet of him, and saw him in action during his short four months in Vietnam before he finished manipulating the systemand ran for cover just as soon as he could. Now that those brave men who stayed for their full tour of duty (including many who could have left after they got their purple hearts) are speaking up, they are attacked by the same people who found no problem with multibillionaires funding their \\"527\\" sleaze machines against President Bush.ver just as soon as he could. Now that those brave men who stayed for their full tour of duty (including many who could have left after they got their purple hearts) are speaking up, they are attacked by the same people who found no problem with multibillionaires funding their \\"527\\" sleaze machines against President Bush. <br />
      1 William L. Masterton has a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry and retired as a full Professor from the University of Connecticut in 1987. He had a long standing interest in this case, and began research after he retired (p.8). Chapters 1 to 8 give his short history of this crime, chapters 9 to 16 give his \\"solution\\". Many books have been written on the Borden Murders; the Sources on page 7 do not list those by E. Pearson and F. Spiering. Only two people were alive in that house after 11am. Lizzie was the likeliest suspect, but she couldn't have done it, and the jury agreed.    \\"Early accounts of the crime were loaded with factual errors\\" (p.18). This is a warning against using unverified newspaper records (p.8). Did Andrew Borden prosper handsomely (p.24)? The truth is that Andrew induced grieving customers to sign up for loans, then called these loans to foreclose on the homes. Andrew got rich by swindling widows and orphans! He became richer by buying into banks and factories, and real estate in growing Fall River. If one of his tenants received a higher salary, Andrew raised his rent. Andrew sold products from his home (p.25); he bought spoiled apple cider and sold it as vinegar. Page 34 quotes Bridget on the murders: \\"I'd be afraid to say anything at all. If I did, that terrible man that killed poor Mrs Borden might come back and kill me too.\\" What did she know and when did she know it?    Page 94 asks why Lizzie didn't burn that dress before the police searched the house. That would have left a residue in the stove. Page 107 talks about the three doors, but says nothing about cellar windows being used to get into the house. Page 124 says the assassin could go upstairs to the guest room to hide, but be discovered by Abby. The jury found Lizzie not guilty. The same lack of evidence also applies to Bridget, and Lizzie said \\"it wasn't Bridget ....\\" Robert Pinkerton says \\"an innocent person is more likely to make conflicting statements than is a guilty on.\\" (His firm was hired by Lizzie.)    Chapter 21 discusses the missing note. Could this explain why Abby went to the second floor guest room? AR Brown has a better explanation for this note. Her discovery of \\"Nemesis\\" led to her unplanned murder. Then this rage must have been directed to Andrew after he turned over that white box. The opinion of Dr Abbot (pp.200-1) seems to be political, not medical. JV Morse's answer (p.202) seems like a way to answer without saying anything. Chapter 14 questions the time of death for Abby. The fact is that Abby was last seen alive about 9:15am, her body was discovered around noon. Since she had been killed earlier than Andrew, the 90 minute estimate is dead accurate. The charts on page 205 are meaningless without indexes for time and temperature. The unscientific studies on page 206 are contradicted by Dr. Dolan's tests on the bodies. The trial testimony quoted on page 210 really means that if a stomach empties between \\"two or three hours\\" there is no estimate possible after this time. Nicole's empty stomach would put her death 3 hours after her 8pm supper. Ron's stomach should show eating between 10:30pm and 11pm (my estimate).    Chapter 16 has one of his solutions: an embezzling bank clerk who played the stock market But a white collar crime like this rules out a double murder? Was it JW Carpenter, who embezzled from Andrew's funeral business? Or maybe J Clegg? Masterton didn't solve the crime! Arnold R Brown's book provided the final solution in theory, because no one has come up with a better one. Masterton's fable violates the known facts of the case.
      1 While there are some interesting tidbits, the author's hatred towards Oklahoma is so profound that he cannot be taken seriously by any open-minded reader.  There is little doubt that the author approached this book with an anti-Oklahoma premise, and then collected unverified rumors to support his premise.<br />Recently the author has posted on bulletin boards suggesting that Texans should threaten 18-year old kids with future employment discrimination should the kids decide to go to school in Oklahoma.<br />The author has bizarre views, irrational hatred, and little credibility.  His views are embarrassing to real Longhorn fans.
      1 While the layout, date code information, and index are very well done, many marks are dated incorrectly.... some off by decades. This is very misleading and frustrating. Due to the Kovels' apparent vast experience,  collectors and dealers tend to believe whatever they write... right or  wrong! As an author and china mark historian, I hope the Kovels remove any  unverified mark usage dates in a future edition. To list a few examples,  they say mark 195L is semiporcelain, 1886-1898. The correct information  according to the manufacturer (now Syracuse China, then Onondaga Pottery)  is vitrified china 1897-1946. Also they indicate mark 127J is a current  mark, but this backstamp was actually used 1930s - early 1950s. Then there  is mark 105N listed as faience 1891+, which should be porcelain 1959-1969  according to the company. Other knowledgeable and observant collectors and  dealers have noticed similar discrepancies.
      1 While computers and the Internet are very useful tools, they have been oversold outside of the technical and database vocations.  Education is no exception.  The dysfunctional result from public schools appears more a consequence of politicized bureaucracy and an either indifferent or confused citizenry than from lack of resources.  (suggested reading:  _In_Pursuit_ by Charles Murray or _Inside_American_Education by Thomas Sowell.)  <br />As tools, computers remain cranky if useful devices -- an observation made from running Fortran code in highschool and college since the mid-1970s on Univac, CDC, PDP, SGI, HP on a plethora of operating systems.  The code gets fancier, and memory faster to access, but it's no panacea.  The medium is too narrow for anything but task-specific operations, and very frustrating as a learning portal, irrespective of baud rate.  <br />Dr Stoll's conversational style perhaps fills the pages more than necessary, but his critics are unable to refute his arguments against the superficial and unverified content of the Internet debases research or the distracting nature of visual graphics advertised to facilitate learning or the wretched quality of current software development and computer ergonomics or the expensive maintenance of equipment that's obsolete when manufactured, never mind installed.  <br />The hype from electronics promoters neglects to mention the advantages of durable media -- primarily books (with text).  This failing is evident even in scholarly studies, such as _Integrating_Information_Technology_in_Education_ that exhorts yet more electrons knocked from their p-orbital shells to placate the god &quot;nolij&quot; but no understanding or mastery that comes from self-discipline and investigative study.  _High_Tech_Heretic_ serves as an appropriate counterweight to this latest and expensive fad.
      1 When I originally purchased and began to read Talbot's presentation, I was intrigued by the way he proposed to explain some of the mysterious or unexplained phenomena of the past and present through an honest inquiry. He  applied a blend of both scientific theory and speculations from traditional  mysticism to the table. He includes discussions of some of the stranger  aspects of quantum physics that have challenged modern physicists with  their counter-intuitiveness and introduces the concept of the HOLOGRAPH as  a possible model of reality. Yet he feels the need to combine these points  with paranormal or &quot;supernatural&quot; mysteries from the past, as  well as his own experiences. In the end, however, he clearly veers towards  his own assumptions and uncritically accepts much of the dubious  superstitions and supernatural claims of less enlightened historical times.  He does not actually present any real evidence for his argument or  hypothesis, but descends into personal anecdotes (i.e. unverified claims)  about his own bizzare &quot;experiences&quot;(hallucinations?). The book is  interesting up to a point, but quickly degenerates into yet another  &quot;New Age&quot; attempt to elevate magical-spiritual-supernatural  nonsense to the level of legitimate and testable science. Very unfortunate  indeed.
      1 What a disappointing, bizarre and almost un-American book this was. To start off with, my back ground is 10 years ex Naval aviation and the term \\"Flyboy\\" is not a flattering term I would use to describe me or any of my comrades and the author uses this term through out the entire book as if it were an honorary title or rank to be used in front of each veterans name. The book is written at a grade school level as if it were attempting to give a quick history lesson leading up to WWII and takes almost the first 3rd of the book to get to the real story, which leads me up to my biggest complaint about this book. The author uses obscure incidents and wars as well as unverified single sources to paint a picture of America as an evil imperial power that went around killing innocent people (In the Philippines) as the rule instead of the exception and the last time I checked my history books many thousands of American lives were lost \\"liberating\\" the Philippines in the fall of 1944 as well as hundreds more in Iraq to this day so I take offense to his twisting of history. The author sucked me in with the fancy book cover and catchy title into thinking I was about to learn more about some of the missing pieces of the vast puzzle that is WWII but instead was subjected (granted I could have stopped reading) to a liberal political correct story of how these American veterans deserved their fates because of past American actions. For people interested in learning about past American veterans try the \\"Medal Of Honor\\" book by Peter Collier and you will defiantly walk away feeling much more inspired with the human spirit. I feel the best books about veterans are generally those written by veterans and this author should think of a possible new career as a fiction writer and leave the history telling to others. Anybody want to buy my book?&lt;smile&gt;
      1 We have this book online: [...] <BR>It has now been about one hundred and sixty years since the first publication of perhaps the greatest apologetics book of all times. It is true that there are many fine books suited for their specific objects, and not less true that many valuable books have fulfilled a particular demand in the needful evidences for the Christian Evangelical Faith; but none can be found that has so comprehensively covered the ground in a way that not only reaches all essential beliefs or doctrines necessary for life in this world and that to come, but that also has been so recognized by the church at large to be so. When we come to this volume and are delightfully and almost magnetically carried through it, we soon find that it is not such a piece of the puzzle that books before it were, but rather it satisfies the heart and mind of the candid inquirer quenching his universal and systematic desires for the unified system of belief.<BR>  In the introduction below, we are informed that the arguments presented in this volume are largely independent of other works and not borrowed. Notwithstanding the style and harmony of all the chapters however, it can be seen through the works we are publishing that the major ideas were borrowed from worthy and spiritually sympathetic authors just previous to the first publication. And much more than Darwin, who organized an unsystematized-and unfortunately false-natural philosophy into a compelling system which thus gave it credibility, our author gives us more than a coherent hypothesis yet to be verified, but rather a presentation that unifies the subjects of the highest importance with the best demonstrations from all the important departments of the mind and life.<BR>  Those familiar with Asa Mahan's encyclopedic writings on all major branches of philosophy will find a very close identity of presenting the philosophical ideas in this book. Equally manifest will be the relation to Charles G. Finney's understanding of reformation and disinterested benevolence. And while Jonathan Edwards first presented this last idea less developed, our author no doubt also borrows much from him in his analysis of the Affections. We will finally notice but one more author, Caleb Burge, whose monumental work on the Atonement in 1822 must have had influence on the illustrations given in this work.<BR> These men all shared the same moral government and orthodox understanding of the Plan of Salvation, and their profound works in our opinion helped to elevate society and the church to a higher level than it ever knew and has since known. The reason is plain-not that they invented new ideas, or were clever to manipulate men by sophestry-on the contrary, they simply acknowledged their true limitations, sought answers from all facts available, depended upon no unverified evidence, focused on essential matters in the nature of their circumstances, and insisted upon no weak arguments, but gave us an impartial, coherent, system of practical truth that was only to convince an honest mind.<BR>  Some years back we endeavored to compile a similar work, not yet being familiar with this. It is now wondered whether that work would not be a disservice to the subjects defended in comparison with this masterpiece. We do not see the need to improve our work to this level, and are convinced that the world and the church do not need anything further to be satisfied with the objects of this book. In the future it will thus be our desire to only slightly adapt this work to our day (as this was a book for the times) in a recording of this volume for tapes and CD.<BR>We are selling this book $9.50 in print: TruthInHeart.com 616-447-8124
      1 Verification and validation are two important, if often misunderstood, aspects of delivering the big three: Reliability, Availability and Support.  One of the reasons for this is technology has outstripped methods, which is what this book rectifies.  V&amp;V is not pre-production testing where the goal is to break the application or product, but is a functional qualification test (also known as user acceptance test or product test), where the goal is to ensure that what you have meets requirement specifications. Specifically, verification answers &quot;did we build the right thing?&quot; and validations answers &quot;did we build it right?&quot;<br />It's one thing to perform V&amp;V for products and monolithic applications and quite another to apply these techniques to more complex systems.  This book updates the V&amp;V body of knowledge by showing how to perform V&amp;V in objected-oriented and distributed environments, with an emphasis on specific system types such as data warehouses, inter- and internet systems, etc.<br />The authors start with a description of processes, models and standards that give you a foundation for incorporating V&amp;V, and then discuss tools and methodologies, documentation and metrics.  I especially liked the metrics provided, which will allow you to effectively and accurately measure your V&amp;V process.<br />Another strong point about this book is that it addresses objected-oriented methods, which are difficult to verify and validate.  Here is a real life example why:  a global 50 company bought into a directory-enabled security scheme as the basis for their enterprise security. Such schemes are object-oriented and complex. At no point did the company verify or validate what they were buying into, either as a concept of the component products.  Worse, the consulting company that &quot;sold&quot; it did not have any design proofs which could be verified and validated, nor did the consulting company or the global 50 company develop any structured acceptance testing.  Net result:  there is a large company that is betting the security of its internal and external applications on an unverified and unvalidated security scheme.  The information in this book would have given both parties a structured approach with which to ensure that what looks good on paper actually works when you implement the design, especially with products that bring with them their own set of flaws. I cited this true story to underscore the value of V&amp;V and to show how often it is not used for mission-critical systems.<br />The coverage of complex system types and development approaches in this book is must reading by anyone in QA, especially if QA is only performing pre-production testing.  V&amp;V is a necessary stage in the development (or procurement) process to ensure that what is eventually going into production conforms to what was specified.  If your organization does not perform V&amp;V then this book is all the more important, and will give you the processes and approaches to integrate it into your QA organization.  If you are a QA practitioner who is currently performing V&amp;V this book will provide techniques and approaches that will help you meet the growing challenges of verifying and validating increasingly complex systems.  Finally, if you are a vendor manager for outsourced application development or application services that are provided from an ASP this book with give you a complete approach to verifying and validating the product or services for which you are contracting.p any structured acceptance testing.

      4 I had to laugh at the few low ratings by raving zealots. If you are a person, that has always asked &quot;too many questions,&quot; this book is for you! Whether you are a Philosopher, Theologian, or Agnostic, this book is a welcome addition to your fiction collection. This book makes you think, so Fun-dam-entalists should probably skip this one. Right or Wrong, this book will get your wheels turning...which is all that really matters, right? <br />As a voracious reader, I have read the best. &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; is a heart-stopping thriller that keeps you turning pages until you arrive exhausted at the end. You're truly &quot;in on the chase.&quot; Improbable as it seems, Dan Brown has combined nuclear physics and antimatter with Renaissance art, old Rome and the Vatican. You conjure up the images in your mind, but the icing on the cake is Brown's Web site, which shows you the CERN facilities, the plane and then the exquisite artwork of Bernini and others as well as a peek inside the Vatican. It's a book that teaches, makes you think, and entertains, all at the same time. Few authors can accomplish that. <br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. Read `Holy Blood, Holy Grail,' and ANYTHING by Ken Follett! I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Another fun book is Brad Steiger's 'Werewolf.' I also really liked Dan Brown's `Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.<br />For those who say this book goes against their beliefs and their dogma, consider this: The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research! <BR>Buy this book, you will love it.
      3 I was surprised to read one review of Science and Health titled, &quot;Strange Days Indeed. Most peculiar.&quot; posted on 12/30/02; because my reading and studying of the book has lead me to the opposite conclusion.  Using Science and Health's healing system has brought cure to all kinds of health-related problems I've experienced.  It's proved so successful in my life that I now use its methods for dealing with most anything that comes up in the day.  So rather than being a healing book for the 1800's, I find it fresh with new and even startling ideas about my relationship to the higher power. The very fact that there has been successful healing for over 125 years has strengthened my confidence in it.<br />The reviewer also mentioned that &quot;over the long-term,&quot; this health system has been, &quot;unsuccessful and sometimes deadly.&quot; And that &quot;the average life span of a Christian Scientist is shorter than national average.&quot;  I'm not sure where that information came from or what study is being referenced. I can only speak for myself-- the ideas in Science and Health have saved my life and given me a life.  While, regrettably there is not a 100% record of successful healing, I like to know what health system, including medical, can boost of such a record?<BR>Yet ironically, we hardly hear about the sad errors of these other systems. This is not to air dirty laundry or debate, but to simply point out that no side has a perfect record.  There are thousands of verified published healings, as well as those in Science and Health that attest to its healing efficacy. <br />It's interesting to note that in the United States more people spend money on alternative than on traditional medicine with prayer being a preferred method for many.  Perhaps that is why spirituality books, like Science and Health, continue to be one of the hottest selling categories in bookstores.  As a best seller for over 90 years it continues to gain popularity, with more copiesselling in the last five years than any time before.  So rather than relegating it to &quot;religious history&quot; I see it as the future of religion and medicine.
      3 I had to laugh at the few low ratings by raving zealots. If you are a person, that has always asked &quot;too many questions,&quot; this book is for you! Whether you are a Philosopher, Theologian, or Agnostic, this book is a welcome addition to your fiction collection. This book makes you think, so Fun-dam-entalists should probably skip this one. Right or Wrong, this book will get your wheels turning...which is all that really matters, right? <br />As a voracious reader, I have read the best. &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; is a heart-stopping thriller that keeps you turning pages until you arrive exhausted at the end. You're truly &quot;in on the chase.&quot; Improbable as it seems, Dan Brown has combined nuclear physics and antimatter with Renaissance art, old Rome and the Vatican. You conjure up the images in your mind, but the icing on the cake is Brown's Web site, which shows you the CERN facilities, the plane and then the exquisite artwork of Bernini and others as well as a peek inside the Vatican. It's a book that teaches, makes you think, and entertains, all at the same time. Few authors can accomplish that. <br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. Read `Holy Blood, Holy Grail,' and ANYTHING by Ken Follett! I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Another fun book is Brad Steiger's 'Werewolf.  Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.<br />For those who say this book goes against their beliefs and their dogma, consider this: The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV,RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research! Buy this book, you will love it.
      2 What's really nice about this book is how everything builds upon previous chapters.  The book walks you through each aspect of Javascript with a combination of code and dialogue that keeps you both engaged and actively learning.  I have in fact just completed a course that built upon the foundations of HTML and Javascript and I felt after reading this book certain concepts I did not understand from the class, now make much more sense.  Sanders does in this book what he does best and that is educate.  Some may feel that this is similar to course notes but to be real honest, this book is about one thing, and that is gaining a true understanding of programming language Javascript.  A real treat comes in the third part of the book that incorporates Javascript with other backend programming languages such as ASP and PHP.  Many times as a web designer you are caught in situations that requires a form being verified, data being sent to a database, etc etc, and this book demonstrates the ease of incorporating Javascript with backend languages.  If you want to really learn Javascript for practical use then this is the book to get!
      2 This dictionary makes translations and other inter-conversions between English and Spanish easy and secure.  The headwords are very plain to see, which is not always the case with such dictionaries, and each phrase has its own entry, so that you can find the exact equivalent phrase used in the other language quickly.  After buying this book I went ahead and verified many terms that I am already familiar with, and was happy to see them all there, each with the proper equivalents for each business-related area, such as finance, banking, foreign investment, real estate, contracts, taxes, and so on and so on.  The book earns its five stars each time I use it, and it has not disappointed me yet.
      2 This 1949 classic has lost none of its punch. With his descriptive depiction of the future, Orwell really puts the fear into the reader's heart. With his description of a totalitarian socialist regime, Orwell's masterpiece stimulates a fear that is reminiscent and matched only by The Red Scare of the late 1950s.<br />The most amazing feature of this book is that it still holds relevance today. With America's War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration has started restricting American's basic civil liberties, such as a right to trial. This action almost seems to be a precursor to the restricted socialist atmosphere described so well by Orwell. Still if this book has one message, it is that the individual mind is stronger than any government and that humanity and freewill are things to cherish, not taken for granted. This book is a crystal ball into our country's future and deserves to be read. The founders of our Constitution would be appalled at the current state of the USA and what the Bush cabal is doing to it/us.<br />The ideas in this book are ones that are as appropriate now as when Orwell first wrote them. In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden. Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible in light of our dyslexic Bushisms.<br />It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it. To bad it can't be updated with all the words our low IQ president has created.<br />Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book. In the real world of the 20th/21st century they're done, only much more subtly. That way, we don't know they being perpetrated on us. But with the Patriot Act, the boldness is destroying our Constitution.<br />Here's how 1984 applies to current events:<br />WAR IS PEACE<br />The new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is being sold as a guarantor or our safety. While this war is being waged, we're to accept permanent war as a fact of life. As the unavoidable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we are told to go back to &quot;living our lives.&quot;<br />FREEDOM IS SLAVERY<br />&quot;Freedom itself was attacked,&quot; Bush said. He's right, though here's the twist: Americans are losing many of their most cherished freedoms in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government wants to tap our phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court order. Further, it wants authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or trial. To save freedom, we have to destroy it.<br />IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH<br />America's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.<br />When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you. The world portrayed by Orwell is `HERE AND NOW.\\"<br />If you think it's all a conspiracy... then check out these books also:  I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over.

      2 The plot weaves like an intricate children's bedside story. But the book is not literature by any means or definition. When people are too ignorant to read history and theology, you concoct a fable written to the sixth grade reading level based on two men's interpretation of the Bible. It's kind of like `Religion For Dummies', or `Compassion - For Members Only.'  Holy Blood - Holy Grail is a superior read.<br />The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the five star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:<br />In `Acts 5:30; 10:39.' the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, &quot;Whom ye slew `and' hanged on a tree.&quot; The word &quot;and&quot; is `not' in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, `and then' His dead body was hung on a `tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text. <br />The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research! <br />The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In `I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made `a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an `idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was `idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!<br />In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).<br />In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.<br />The authors claim this is not speculative fiction, but what will happen, more or less, when the rest of us are `Left Behind.' Good riddance, I say. And take all the fundamentalist Muslim fanatics, who are of the same blind ilk, with you.  This is a must read for skeptics of truth and devout fundamentalist zealot Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\"<br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. More conspiracies:  I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.
      2 The only FREE PRESS we have left is the individual author and researcher like Woodward, who makes us think and evaluate our biased corporate-media feed and mal-nurtured minds. As a life long moderate Republican, I cannot let my ideology and prejudices obscure the fact that our President is the most ignorant, deceitful, flippant, embarrassing, and shameful President during my lifetime. I'm 60+ and have voted Republican since Eisenhower. Infringement of our Constitution and Bill of Rights all under the guise of National Security does not bode well for the US and our children's future. <br />The author clearly knows his facts and can prove them. He outlines and reveals the massive lies, propaganda, and deceit of Bush and the neo-cons leading up to the Iraq war. An un-called for war, and a war that put U.S. Soldiers in harms way, needlessly. All the while the Bush administration was cutting military pay, combat pay, and Veterans benefits. Not to mention the billions he cut from the Veteran's Administration budget, denying aid to newly disabled veterans. Shame on them, but mostly shame on our President.<br />The frantic, blind, and zealous followers of King Bush, (King because he was appointed by the Supreme Court and not elected), <BR>Rant and Rave that this is yet another lying assault on their hero.<br />If this is a book of lies, then why does President Bush endorse the book on his re-election site? Perhaps because, our \\"Republicant and donut read wells.\\" (Sorry, my attempt at humor)<br />Seems like the standards of Presidential excellence; the ability to orate and write brilliantly, the deep understanding of history, politics, and the Constitution/Bill of Rights, have died. Shamefully this President has the lowest IQ of ANY President in the history of our country. Several independent studies have evaluated his IQ or lack thereof. It appears a President can start an illegal war, invade a foreign country based on outright lies and deceit, and be a hero to about 50% ofAmericans. What does that say about that particular segment of our citizens? People who refuse to find and seek the truth and act on it; people who value bluster, bragging, showing off, insincerity, lying, passing the buck, and puffery over intellect, truthfulness, and fairness. Read Woodward, and astute, intelligent, logical author with actual facts. <br />Woodward, Clarke, Dean, and the list goes on; are heroes, even if I don't always agree with them, they all have one thing in common. They give us different points of views, decent, alternative arguments, which make ourselves objective and aware. Soldiers, firemen, and policemen are heroes because the risk their lives for us every day, usually unappreciated and underpaid. Why has my president dishonored my fellow American Veterans by not having time to attend NOT ONE funeral of a soldier from a war he started. Yet he's taken more vacations and spent more time at home than ANY President in history. You cannot discount Woodward, he is a savvy Washington reporter and insider who can back up his FACTS, FACTS, and more FACTS! <br />On other conspiracies: if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of  Alien Rapture, by Edgar Fouche, which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's 'Deception Point,; and `Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's; 'Unconventional Flying Objects,' which N-NASA tried to ban, and always read the Amazon reviews.
      2 The fact that any Americans believe this trash is mind-boggling.  The hate that spews from this self-loathing man is gross and pathetic.  He is everything America should never, and will NEVER be.  If you disagree with Savage he stamps the label of \\"liberal\\" on you. This is also a label that he throws around to damn freely. He has it in his warped mind that every gay man, female, Mexican, Muslim, African American, Asian and so on would even classify themselves as a \\"liberal\\". Basically he uses this label and stamps it on people that simply have different beliefs than him. You can't blame everything that's wrong in a society on one group! This is what Hitler did for crying out loud!!!!<br />You can't go 3 sentences in this book without Savage calling someone unpatriotic or a communist or a liberal whom he sees as interchangeable. Every line he calls another person a name without every backing it up. The book is filled with religious rhetoric and anyone who believes this crap is just plain ignorant. Apparently, like Bush, Savage wants to stomp on the Constitution and let religion into our public places, especially schools. He opposed the removal of a granite monument to The 10 Commandments. JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE IN AMERICA OPPOSE YOUR VIEWS OR THE VIEWS OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T MAKE THEIR VIEWS WRONG, OR THE PEOPLE UNPATRIOTIC. <br />The book is horribly written, with little factual information. He just rambles on for sentence after sentence in an unorganized way. If there was any point or message to his writing I couldn't get it through all the homophobia and red scare talk. Apparently Savage thinks we're still in the height of the Cold War the way he claims anyone who is unreligious or opposed to the war in Iraq is a Communist, even though Bush and his whole administration are now proven liars. I can't believe how many reviews support this book; I can't in my right mind see how anyone could see this as a good book or any of his points valid. I for one, am a proud American, and it is people like Savage who perpetuate the idea that America should be for the few not for everyone. If you other reviews want to call me a Communist or whatever for writing this, then go right ahead, it will just show how ignorant and uninformed you are, as well as Savage. <br />He says he supports the military but not one word was written about the cuts in soldier's pay and benefits, cuts in combat pay and overseas cost of living, etc., etc. Nor did he mention anything about Bush's massive cuts in the Veterans Administration health care system for disabled American Patriotic soldiers. Of course he probably got a draft deferment or went hiding into the guard to avoid the Vietnam War, just like the conservatives he blindly supports. Even if you believe this nut-case, the book is poorly written and overly-simplistic.<br />For fun, if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of :The Da Vinci Code' and Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's `Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.
      2 The excellent work, 'Prince of Loyalty' should be read by everyone in America. What we independents hate is that Bush lied over and over and over about the Iraqi threat and The War. He also lied about his military record and even here in Austin it is well known his 'friends' cleaned up his military records while he was governor of Texas. This book should be titled 'The Prince of Liars', and not 'The Price Of Loyalty' !!!! <br />By reading this book, you can gain an inside view of what is happening inside the White House. You can see how this dysfunctional administration is controlled by the political arm headed by Karl Rove and Dick Cheney, and how they viciously pursue their radical right agenda without much concern for the real world or hard facts. <br />If you care about the future of America, you should pick this up before the election, so that you can make an informed choice. God save us from the power broker politicians and their hidden agendas. <br />On a lighter note, if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Another fun book is Brad Steiger's 'Werewolf.' I also really liked Dan Brown's 'Deception Point,; and `Angels and Demons.'
